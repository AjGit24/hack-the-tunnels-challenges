## Description:

Checkout: `client/src/pages/Home/Home.style.scss` to get started.

Using [Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) and the [`flex-wrap` CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap), make the products appear in rows that responsively wrap when the width of the page changes.

Utilize the [gap CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) to set space between each of the items within the Flexbox.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Products are now appear in rows and or a grid instead of one verticle column. Products should wrap onto multiple lines when the width of the page is updated.
