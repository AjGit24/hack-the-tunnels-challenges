## Description:

Implement the full end-to-end [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-ca) payment flow.

The starter project will provide with the means to create an order, however no payment information is required, stored, or verified.

Using Stripe, you will be able to accept real payments through your app.

Create a [Stripe developer account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) and checkout the Stripe ["prebuilt checkout page"](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/quickstart?client=react)

## Acceptance Criteria:

The participant app is able to accept payments through Stripe.
