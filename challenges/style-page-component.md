## Description:

Checkout: `client/src/components/Page` to get started.

The `Page`` component is used in all the pages provided in the project template. By styling this component, it will impact all other pages that utilize this component.

To complete this challenge, at a minimum, stop the contents of page from directly touching the sides of the screen.

However, you should also consider adding some additional styling to further customize your site. Consider updating the color, fonts, text sizing, or anything else you can think of!

## Acceptance Criteria:

The content within the `Page` component no longer touches the edges of the screen.
