## Description:

Checkout: `client/src/components/ProductPreviewCard` to get started.

Experiment with HTML and CSS. Add your own creative spin to the ProductPreviewCard component. Change the spacing, text sizes, colors, or anything you'd like. Just don't submit the default component.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Some new styling and or content structure has been added to the component. Participants are given a lot of creative freedom, so litterally anything that is not the default `ProductPreviewcard` component earns them points here.
