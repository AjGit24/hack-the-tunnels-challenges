Checkout: `client/src/components/Footer` To get started.

Update the footer component to display the following text "Â© 2023 Carleton University". Additionally, the text should be centered. The footer should also have some additional height and padding. See the [`padding` CSS property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp).

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Text is currently shown and is centered 
- There is added padding around the text to make the footer take up a bit more space
