## Description:

Checkout: `client/src/components/Navbar` To get started.

Update the navbar component to meet the following specifications:

1. A logo image (of your choice) should be present on the left side of the navbar in place of the words "Store Logo".

2. The navbar should be fixed to the top of the page. Meaning even if the user scrolls down, the navbar will still be visible. For this challenge, checkout the [`position` CSS property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp). 

3. The "login / sign up / logout" buttons on the right of the navbar should be styled to appear "less default looking". 

4. In order to not have the logo and buttons touching the sides of the screen, the navbar should utilize the the [`padding` CSS property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp). 

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Logo image should appear on left side. It should be reasonably sized (not huge / participant will probably need to give the image a width unless the image itself is small)

- Navbar sticks to the top of page while scrolling down the page

- buttons appear styled

- navbar elements do not touch the sides of the screen
